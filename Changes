    Undid setting processed flag when building result in BUILD. Breaks
    existing apps. Re-thinking that part for now.

0.35000 Thu Jul 21, 2011
    Add support for tabindex attribute.
    Generic html attribute setting (html_attr)
    Set 'processed' flag when building results in BUILD to fix problem
        with garbage collected results.
    *** it's possible that this may break code if field values were being
        set outside of FormHandler, or params were set on new. Pass params
        on process. Set fields inside FormHandler, or run clear first, then
        set values. In general, it works best to update fields inside a
        FormHandler class, in a method or method modifier.
        Building results in 'new' happened originally because people expected
        to be able to do $form->render after new, without process. But you're
        better off always running 'process'.
    Add flag 'no_preload' to skip building results in new (BUILD) if not needed
    Add flag 'no_widgets' to skip applying widgets to fields if not needed
    Fix for Date fields in compounds.
    Types Printable & SingleWord use class messages
