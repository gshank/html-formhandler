package HTML::FormHandler::Model;
# ABSTRACT: default model base class

use Moose::Role;
use Carp;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This class defines the base attributes for FormHandler model
classes. It is not used directly.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an empty base class that defines methods called by
HTML::FormHandler to support interfacing forms with a data store
such as a database.

This module provides instructions on methods to override to create
a HTML::FormHandler::Model class to work with a specific object relational
mapping (ORM) tool.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 item, build_item

The "item" is initialized with "build_item" the first time $form->item is called.
"item" must be defined in the model class to fetch the object based on the item id.
It should return the item's object.  Column values are fetched and updated
by calling methods on the returned object.

For example, with Class::DBI you might return:

    return $self->item_class->retrieve( $self->item_id );

=cut

has 'item' => (
    is      => 'rw',
    lazy    => 1,
    builder => 'build_item',
    clearer => 'clear_item',
    trigger => sub { shift->set_item(@_) }
);
sub build_item { return; }

sub set_item {
    my ( $self, $item ) = @_;

    return $self->item_class( ref $item );
}

=head2 item_id

The id (primary key) of the item (object) that the form is updating
or has just created. The model class should have a build_item method that can
fetch the object from the item_class for this id.

=cut

has 'item_id' => (
    is      => 'rw',
    clearer => 'clear_item_id',
    trigger => sub { shift->set_item_id(@_) }
);

sub set_item_id { }

=head2 item_class

"item_class" sets and returns a value used by the model class to access
the ORM class related to a form.

For example:

   has '+item_class' => ( default => 'User' );

This gives the model class a way to access the data store.
If this is not a fixed value (as above) then do not define the
method in your subclass and instead set the value when the form
is created:

    my $form = MyApp::Form::Users->new( item_class => $class );

The value can be any scalar (or object) needed by the specific ORM
to access the data related to the form.

A builder for 'item_class' might be to return the class of the 'item'.

=cut

has 'item_class' => (
    isa => 'Str',
    is  => 'rw',
);

=head2 guess_field_type

Returns the guessed field type.  The field name is passed as the first argument.
This is only required if using "Auto" type of fields in your form classes.
You could override this in your form class, for example, if you use a field
naming convention that indicates the field type.

The metadata info about the columns can be used to assign types.

=cut

sub guess_field_type {
    Carp::confess "Don't know how to determine field type of [$_[1]]";
}

=head2 lookup_options

Retrieve possible options for a given select field from the database.
The default method returns undef.

Returns an array reference of key/value pairs for the column passed in.
These values are used for the values and labels for field types that
provide a list of options to select from (e.g. Select, Multiple).

A 'Select' type field (or a field that inherits from
HTML::FormHandler::Field::Select) can set a number of scalars that control how
options are looked up:

    label_column()          - column that holds the label
    active_column()         - column that indicates if a row is acitve
    sort_column()           - column used for sorting the options

The default for label_column is "name".

=cut

sub lookup_options { }

=head2 validate_model

Validates fields that are dependent on the model.
This is called via the validation process and the model class
must at least validate "unique" constraints defined in the form
class.

Any errors on a field found should be set by calling the field's
add_error method:

    $field->add_error('Value must be unique in the database');

The default method does nothing.

=cut

sub validate_model { }

=head2 clear_model

Clear out any dynamic data for persistent object

=cut

sub clear_model { }

=head2 update_model

Update the model with validated fields

=cut

sub update_model { }

use namespace::autoclean;
1;
